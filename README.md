# Flutter Namer App

This Flutter app was built as part of the _Write Your First Flutter App_ [Codelab](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab) by Google.<br>
It serves as a beginner-friendly project to explore the fundamentals of Flutter development.

The application **generates cool-sounding names**, such as "newstay", "lightstream", "mainbrake", or "graypine".<br>
The user can ask for the next name, favorite the current one, and review the list of favorited names on a separate page.<br>
The app is **responsive** to different screen sizes.
